# photo-snipe
PhotoSnipe allows a group of friends to play a live action camera game.
## Game Concept:
Each player is trying to catch their friends in public and snap a picture of them without
their friend noticing. A player gets a point for every time they get a picture of someone without
the person noticing.  One player serves as the game mananger who receives all of the pictures taken during
the game and approves them as valid (or not).  Score is kept and is viewable to all players, game rules are
listed, and the time limits on the game are shown to all players.  Each picture is also geo-tagged, and is
viewable to all players in a stream.
